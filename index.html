    <p class="tribute-info">
    Toby Fox started composing a variety of music for Andrew Hussie's 2009 webcomic Homestuck during his senior year of high
    school. Though he did not initially respond when Hussie started a "Music Contribution Team" in April 2009 and put up a
    news post asking musicians to participate, Hussie took note of his work when Fox started uploading piano covers of the
    webcomic's music on the MS Paint Adventures forums. Fox has composed music for the 2017 Homestuck video game
    Hiveswap, Undertale artist Temmie Chang's short narrative game Escaped Chasm, and Game Freak's 2019 RPG Little
    Town Hero, the last of which was arranged by Pokémon composer Hitomi Sato. He also composed a track for Pokémon Sword
    and Shield and a vocal song for Itoki Hana's PRAY album.

    <p class="tribute-info">
      Fox's most well-known work is the 2015 role-playing video game Undertale. The game sold more than 1 million copies,
      becoming a "breakout hit" and "pop-culture phenomenon". Fox worked on the entire game
      independently, besides the art assets—which he asked Temmie (Tuyoki) Chang to help with—to avoid relying on others.

    <p class="tribute-info">
      On October 30, 2018, Fox tweeted a request for fans of Undertale to check the game's official Twitter account in 24
      hours. The following day, Fox released the first chapter of the followup to Undertale, named Deltarune, for free under
      the guise of a "survey". On November 1, Fox shared more details regarding the game, including that the rest of
      the chapters were expected to release simultaneously, but work had not yet started, and there was no estimated timeframe
      for completion. Fox also stated that he had been working on the project since 2012, and that the idea for Undertale
      developed from Deltarune during production. On June 12, 2019, as only the first chapter of Deltarune had been
      playable for several months, Fox expressed on his Twitter account he had hope he would complete the rest of Deltarune,
      saying: "Slowly I'm writing and drawing it all out." He stated that he has written "about 50 songs past Chapter 1".
